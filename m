You may be wondering... Why hire Webrid Marketing? There are thousands and =
thousands of agencies out there, what makes us so unique?=20


For one, you're reading this email. Which means we must be pretty good at w=
hat we do, right?=20


All bragging aside, here is what really makes us the best agency for you:=
=20



1.=C2=A0Our services are proven to drive results for our clients=20

We have real experience implementing successful marketing campaigns. We've =
helped our clients increase sales by over=C2=A0$96,000 through SEO. We've c=
reated Facebook ads that have increased sales by over=C2=A0500% for small b=
usinesses. You deserve an agency that has a strong track record in driving =
results.=20



2. All of our work is performed in house=20

The quality of outsourced work is rarely better than work produced internal=
ly. We have complete control over the quality of services delivered to you =
to ensure a positive experience at our agency. All of our work is produced =
in-house at our headquarters.=20



3. Our staff is specialized & highly experienced=20

Our staff is divided into specialized departments based on their skills, ed=
ucation, and experience. This means that you will have various experts on y=
our team based on the service(s) you sign-up for. For example, if you sign-=
up for one of our advertising services, you will work with one of our ad sp=
ecialists who have experience running successful ad campaigns.=20



4.=C2=A0Our prices are fixed and never change=20

The traditional agency pricing model is to charge you a % of your ad spend,=
 or budget. We believe that this pricing model is unfair, and have develope=
d a fixed fee model to only charge you based on delivering the services req=
uired to generate results for your business.=20



5. Our prices fit small businesses perfectly=20

We've designed our pricing to fit the budget of any small business. The mar=
ket may quote anywhere from $500 - $10,000/month for specific digital marke=
ting services. Our average price range for our services range from $400-$80=
0 month per month, with bulk discounts as you add more services.=20



6. Our contracts are low-risk.=20

Our initial contract period is 3 months, and afterwards it transpires into =
month-to-month terms. Most agencies require 6-12 month contracts, which can=
 be nerve-wrecking for small businesses owners if you're not seeing results=
.=20
